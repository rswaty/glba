## Goals of this demonstration

I put this together with [LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/){target="blank"} data (and model results) to:

1. Help us think through the area of interest
2. Give us an initial look at vegetation across the entire area
3. Set the stage for exploration of other related datasets.

**All maps and charts should be considered draft if this statement is here. **
